# Downloadable Python Workshop Files

The files in this folder can be downloaded individually to your computer.  To do so, click on the name of the file you'd like to download above (such as "02_Functions.ipynb.zip").  This will bring you to another page on GitHub.  There, either click the "Download" button or the "View Raw" link.  They will do the same thingâ€”trigger the download of the `.zip` file.  Open/Unpack/Decompress the `.zip` file on your computer, and then open the resulting `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebooks.
