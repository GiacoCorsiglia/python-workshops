    "Generally in computer programming, there are *objects* which are 'things' and there are *functions* that perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In math, a function is something that takes inputs, and generates an output. In python, the idea of a function is similar except that in python functions can sometimes take no inputs, take a variety of inputs, or not generate an output (and instead only *do* something.\n",

    "We've already seen some functions that are built-in to python. They perform convenient actions that you might otherwise have to tell the comupter how to do yourself by writing your own code.\n",

You need open and closed parenthesis (and provide handles for anything you *pass* to the function). And finally end the line with a colon. Indent one level, then write the body of your function.\n",
